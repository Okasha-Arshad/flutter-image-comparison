# Flutter Image Comparison using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)

A **cross-platform Flutter app** for **image comparison** using a **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model**. This project helps you **compare images for similarity** on **mobile** (Android & iOS), **web**, and **desktop** platforms. It leverages machine learning (ML) models to determine the **similarity** between two images.

## Features

- **Cross-platform** mobile app (Android, iOS) built with **Flutter**.
- Uses **TensorFlow Lite** (`.tflite`) for **real-time image comparison** and **similarity detection**.
- Upload images and compare them for similarity using machine learning.
- Supports both **local image comparison** and **cloud-based models**.
- **Fast** and **efficient** inference for **image processing** with TensorFlow Lite.
- Simple **user interface (UI)** to upload and compare images easily.
- Open-source project to help developers implement image similarity solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Flutter** SDK (compatible with your OS) â€“ [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK** (comes with Flutter)
- A **code editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)
- **TensorFlow Lite** model for image comparison (e.g., a `.tflite` model)
